# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest released version of `xnatctl` on a
best-effort basis.

If you report a vulnerability against an older release, maintainers may ask you
to reproduce the issue on the latest version first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email the maintainer directly at **rickywonglt15@outlook.com** with:

- A description of the vulnerability and impacted functionality.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept.
- The version of `xnatctl` and your environment details.
- Any suggested remediation, if available.

You will receive an acknowledgment as quickly as possible, typically within
5 business days.

After triage, maintainers will coordinate remediation and public disclosure.
We ask that you provide reasonable time to resolve the issue before sharing
details publicly.
